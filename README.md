# COVID-19-Symptom-and-Test-Indication-Prediction
This project analyzes COVID-19 test results based on symptoms such as cough, fever, and other factors like age, gender, and test indication (e.g., travel history). It aims to predict whether an individual will test positive or negative for COVID-19 based on these features.
